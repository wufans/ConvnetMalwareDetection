# ConvnetMalwareDetection
Reproduction of "Deep Convolutional Malware Classifiers Can Learn from Raw Executables and Labels Only"

A malware detection model based on binaries file only~ We get a accuracy about 91% in 2606 malware samples and 1700 benign samples.

#Train the model
```
python train.py example.csv
```
The "example.csv" is a document that includes the file names and labels of all of your dataset.

This repository is based on the work of **Malconv**（https://github.com/j40903272/MalConv-keras）, which reproduces the work of https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09435.
